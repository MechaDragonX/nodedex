# NodeDex

## What is NodeDex?
NodeDex is a PokéDex website written in TypeScript and compiled in a Node.js environment, hence the name. This is largely a project for fun, but I want to incorporate features of the popular Pokémon fansites, like [Serebii](https://www.serebii.net/), [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/), and [Pokémon DB](https://pokemondb.net/) and hopefully make a site than their PokéDex sections.

## How do I run it?
As stated before, this project is written in TypeScript which compiles in a Node.js environment to JS. Make sure to install the [`typescript`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [`ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-node) packages to allow the project to run and then install all the packages specified in the `package.json`. Here are the commands you'll need:
```shell
$ npm install -g typscript
$ npm install -g ts-node
$ npm i
$ ts-node src
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:1996/.
Why that port number? Cuz [February 27, 1996](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Day)

## Will this be the final name?
Probably not, but I can't be bothered at the moment. lol

## Anything Else
TBA
